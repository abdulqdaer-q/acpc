• Focus on **quality of practice**, not quantity
• Aim for **concentrated, distraction-free problem-solving sessions**
• **However**: Do not let a day pass without solving at least one problem

There is no universal answer. The timeline depends on:

• Your commitment to continuous improvement

However, if you commit to:
• Participating in **all contests**
• Learning necessary **topics** (fundamentals and advanced)
• Solving **random problems** up to rating 1600

You **will** reach at least a **reasonable level** of competitive programming skill. Many have followed this exact approach and achieved Expert, Candidate Master, and Master ranks.

Remember:
• Stay consistent with practice and contests
• Accept that struggle and failure are part of growth
• Focus on learning, not just rating
• Trust the process and be patient with yourself

This approach has been proven by many successful competitive programmers. If they can do it, so can you.

**Good luck, and happy coding!**`
